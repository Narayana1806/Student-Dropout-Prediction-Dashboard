### **by : VenkataLakshmiNarayana Narayana Pirla**

## 📌 Overview  
The **AI-Based Student Dropout Prediction & Counseling System** is a fully responsive, intelligent web dashboard that predicts a student's dropout risk and provides automated counseling recommendations.  
It uses academic scores, personal factors, behavior metrics, and simple heuristics to compute a **0–100% dropout probability**.

If the risk is high (≥ 70%), the system can **instantly alert parents through WhatsApp**, helping institutions intervene early.

This is designed as an affordable and powerful solution for schools and colleges in India.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Detect dropout-prone students early  
- Provide personalized counseling strategies  
- Improve teacher–student–parent communication  
- Reduce academic failures and absences  
- Support institutions with AI-powered decision-making  
- Promote an early-warning culture in education
